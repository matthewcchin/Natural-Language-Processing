# 📚 Natural Langauge Processing Repository

Welcome to this collection of projects exploring **Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Each project demonstrates different techniques and approaches for working with text data, from sentiment classification to entity extraction.

---

## 📂 Projects Overview

1. **📊 Sentiment Analysis**
   - Perform sentiment classification on textual data using pretrained models (VADER & TextBlob).
   - Pipeline: Data acquisition → Cleaning → Tokenization → Vectorization → Model application → Evaluation.

2. **📑 Text Classification**
   - Categorize texts into predefined classes using supervised machine learning models.
   - Focus on preprocessing, feature extraction, and model comparison.

3. **🗂️ Topic Modeling**
   - Discover hidden thematic structures in large text datasets using unsupervised learning techniques like LDA.
   - Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and model tuning.

4. **🏷️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Identify and extract named entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) from text.
   - Leverage pretrained NLP models and explore rule-based approaches.
